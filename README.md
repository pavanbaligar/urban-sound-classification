This project involves classifying urban sound recordings into one of several categories using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a model that can accurately identify different urban sounds such as car horns, dog barks, and sirens.

Project Details
Dataset: The project uses a dataset of urban sounds, including training and test sets.
Model: A RandomForestClassifier model is used for classification.
Accuracy: Achieved 91% accuracy on the test set.
